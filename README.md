## What is Social Jailbreak?

Social media platforms have become "social jails" where users are captive to retention mechanisms and restrictive publishing interfaces. Social Jailbreak is a browser extension and app that:

1. **Intercepts your publications** with a rich text editor (like Grammarly for freedom)
2. **Stores the original** in a decentralized network (IPFS + ActivityPub)
3. **Adapts and publishes** to commercial platforms automatically
4. **Lets you consult** an aggregated, algorithm-free feed from all your networks

## Why It Matters

Migration from social media monopolies fails because it's a **collective decision**, not individual. Social Jailbreak solves this by letting you stay where your friends are while building the free web in parallel.

## Status

**Phase:** Prototype planning (January 2026)  
**Original concept:** Published 2018 in Journal of Brief Ideas

## Architecture (Phase 1 MVP)

- **Pop-up Editor:** Browser extension intercepting text fields
- **Backend:** Python/FastAPI
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL → IPFS (Phase 2)
- **Federation:** ActivityPub integration
- **Platform APIs:** Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, Mastodon

## Get Involved

- **Developers:** Especially ActivityPub/IPFS expertise needed
- **Beta testers:** Activist and academic communities welcome
- **Funding:** Seeking European infrastructure grants
